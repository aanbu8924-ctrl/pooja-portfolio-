To build a portfolio using HTML, you'll create a single index.html file that serves as the main page of your website. This file will contain all the fundamental content and structure. You'll then use a separate CSS file to style your page, and optionally a JavaScript file to add interactivity.

Essential HTML Structure
Every HTML page needs a basic boilerplate. You'll start with the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration and a root <html> element. The document is divided into two main parts: the <head> and the <body>.
 * <head>: Contains metadata about the page, such as the title that appears in the browser tab, character set, and a link to your CSS stylesheet. This content isn't visible on the webpage itself.
 * <body>: Contains all the visible content of your portfolio, including text, images, links, and more.
Here's the basic boilerplate:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Your Name | Portfolio</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
    </body>
</html>

Key Sections for a Portfolio
A well-structured portfolio uses semantic HTML tags to organize content logically. This helps with accessibility and search engine optimization (SEO).
1. Header and Navigation
Use the <header> element for the top section of your page. Inside, include a navigation menu with <nav> and an unordered list <ul> of links to different sections of your page (e.g., "About," "Projects," "Contact").
<header>
    <h1>Your Name</h1>
    <nav>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#about">About</a></li>
            <li><a href="#projects">Projects</a></li>
            <li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>
        </ul>
    </nav>
</header>

2. About Me Section
Use a <section> with an id of "about". This is where you'll introduce yourself. Include a heading <h2>, a paragraph <p> with a brief bio, and an image <img> of yourself.
<section id="about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <img src="your-photo.jpg" alt="A photo of you">
    <p>
        Hi, I'm [Your Name], a [Your Profession]. I specialize in...
    </p>
</section>

3. Projects Section
Create another <section> with an id of "projects". For each project, you can use an <article> tag. Inside each article, include a project title <h3>, an image <img> of the project, a description <p>, and a link <a> to the live demo or a GitHub repository.
<section id="projects">
    <h2>My Work</h2>
    <article>
        <h3>Project 1: [Project Name]</h3>
        <img src="project1-image.png" alt="A screenshot of Project 1">
        <p>A brief description of Project 1 and what it does.</p>
        <a href="https://github.com/your-username/project1" target="_blank">View on GitHub</a>
    </article>
    </section>

4. Contact Section
Use a final <section> with an id of "contact" to provide your contact information. You can use a form <form> or simply a list of links to your professional social media profiles (e.g., LinkedIn, GitHub) and your email.
<section id="contact">
    <h2>Get in Touch</h2>
    <p>Feel free to reach out to me via email or connect on social media.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Email: <a href="mailto:youremail@example.com">youremail@example.com</a></li>
        <li>LinkedIn: <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/yourprofile" target="_blank">Your LinkedIn</a></li>
        <li>GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/your-username" target="_blank">Your GitHub</a></li>
    </ul>
</section>

5. Footer
The <footer> element is for the bottom of the page. It often contains a copyright notice or other relevant information.
<footer>
    <p>&copy; 2025 Your Name. All Rights Reserved.</p>
</footer>

Adding Style and Interactivity
While HTML provides the structure, CSS is what makes it look good. Create a separate style.css file and link it in your HTML's <head>. You'll use CSS to set colors, fonts, layout, and responsiveness.
For more advanced features like a navigation menu that collapses on mobile, you'll need JavaScript. It's a common practice to link a script.js file at the bottom of the <body> tag.
